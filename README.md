I created this website to showcase all my skills and projects. It was developed from scratch in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because I wanted to use this page to serve as a showcase of my front-end web development abilities. All the code for this website is viewable at the Github link at the top of this page. While designing this page, I wanted it to have a more playful creative tone while also being simple and professional. I also wanted it to feel more like an experience than a static webisite and so I tried my best to make the website interactive without being excessive. I also strived to keep in mind proper UI principles and accessibility guidelines.
