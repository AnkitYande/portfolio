I created this website to showcase my skills and projects. It was developed from scratch using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as I wanted it to serve as a representation of my front-end web development abilities.

While designing this page, I aimed to create a playful and creative tone, while also keeping it simple and professional. I wanted the site to feel more like an experience than just a static website, so I focused on making it interactive without being excessive. Throughout the design process, I made sure to adhere to proper UI principles and accessibility guidelines.

I hope you enjoy it!
