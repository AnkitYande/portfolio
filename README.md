I created this website to showcase all my skills and projects. It was developed from scratch in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript because I wanted to use this page to serve as a showcase of my front-end web development abilities.While designing this page, I wanted it to have a playful and creative tone while also being simple and professional. I also wanted it to feel more like an experience than a static webisite and so I tried my best to make the website interactive without being excessive. When designing the website I strived to keep in mind proper UI principles and accessibility guidelines. Hope you enjoy!
