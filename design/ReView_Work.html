        <h1>Design work for ReView Technology Inc.</h1>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 2em">
            This page houses my design work for ReView Technology Inc. ReView is a machine learning powered tool that
            allows users to know if an item they wish to dispose of is recyclable or compostable in their area by taking
            a picture of it. Their goal is to create a greener future by making it easier to sort your disposables
            thereby reducing the amount of trash that goes to landfills. More on them can be found <a
                href="https://www.reviewtechnology.ai/"> here </a>

        <h2>Part 1: Logo Design</h2>
        <div class="tab">

            <h4 style="margin-top: 2em">Task</h4>
            <p>
                Redesign the current logo to stand out and better represent the company.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img style="width: 150px" src="./imgs/ReViewLogoOld.png" />
            </div>
            <h4>Goals:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a combinational logo whose pictoral component can be used stand alone as the app's icon</li>
                <li>Use a set of colors that better represent the company's identity</li>
                <li>Make the logo represent the app's functionality</li>
                <li>Make the logo minimal and modern</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5em">Step 1: Sketches</h4>
            <p>
                This was my first time actually designing a Logo for a client. I began by sketching different concepts
                for the logo on my iPad using Procreate. The left side of the following image show some of the moteifs I
                was experimenting with including a camera, cycling arrows, the letter 'R', a magnifying glass (to
                represent searching), and some leaves (to represent the environment).
            </p>
            <p>
                The right side of my divider shows 10 of the final logos I was most pleased with. The top rightmost a
                finished
                vector logo made in Adobe Illustrator, which I though would be a good final logo to present to the
                company. The finished logo is supposed to be a camera in the shape of a trashbin tying in the ideas of
                the app's core feature (using the camera) and what it detects (the user's disposables)
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img style="width: 800px; margin-top: 2em" src="./imgs/ReView_logos_1.png" />
            </div>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5em">Feedback</h4>
            <p>
                When presenting my final logo to the company it was clear that they did not understand the concept of
                the logo. They could not tell that the body of the camera was supposed to represent a wastebin and
                though that the logo was lacking overall. They though that logos 6 and 7 were actually the best and
                encouraged me to try to move forward with those.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img style="width: 350px; margin-top: 2em" src="./imgs/star_logos.png" />
            </div>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5em">Iteration</h4>
            <p>
                I took the two favored logos and brought them into Illustrator and began to refine them.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img style="width: 350px; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em" src="./imgs/ReView_logos_2.png" />
            </div>
            <p>
                However, after this design session, I wasn't particularly happy with any of the logos. Playing around
                different colors did not help improve the logos substantially either. I decided to reach out to another
                UX designer with more experience to help me. Together we sketched out some more and ended up refining
                the ideo of a leaf camera combining some of my previous sketches. I brought these ideas into illustrator
                and refined them into presentable logos to show my clients.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img style="width: 400px; margin-top: 2em" src="./imgs/ReView_logos_3.png" />
            </div>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5em">Finalizing the Logo</h4>
            <p>
                The company ended up really liking this new logo but had a similar issue to the first one: they could
                not tell that it was supposed to represent a leaf at first. To fix this, we experimented with more of a
                green color. I also though that the two tone wordmark would be good for separating the companies name
                but they were adamant about keeping it spelled "ReView"
            </p>
            <p>
                After working with the founder, we ended up with a finalized logo with three primary colors that later
                became the basis of the company. We chose to stick with a simple font to capture the feeling of a
                technology startup. The logo met the goals of being a pictoral or combinational logo, used greens and
                blues to represent recycling, and symbolized the company's goal of creating a greener
                future, all while being modern and relatively minimal.
            </p>

        <h2>Part 2: App Design</h2>
        <div class="tab">
            <h4 style="margin-top: 2em">Task</h4>
            <p>
                Redesign the current app to better represent the company.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450"
                    src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2F5zDeK3AedUOHh4Skf5sSOi%2FYande-Review-Work%3Fnode-id%3D101%253A1293"
                    allowfullscreen>
                </iframe>
            </div>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 2em">Requirements:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fix the flow to have multiple branches</li>
                <li>Make the app design more inline with the Logo and New Overall Branding</li>
                <li>Refine the app design to make it look more modern and professional </li>

            </ul>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 2em">Step 1: Determining the Application Flow</h4>
            <p>
                In the figma design provided to me there was a single flow that was prototyped and the founder had more
                features that he had already started developing that were not included. To organize the current and
                upcoming features I first created an information architecture flowchart. This let me understand the key
                features of the app and layed the groundwork for prototyping the app in the future.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450"
                    src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2F5zDeK3AedUOHh4Skf5sSOi%2FYande-Review-Work%3Fnode-id%3D107%253A1301"
                    allowfullscreen>
                </iframe>
            </div>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 2em">Step 2: Ethnographic Research on Similar Apps</h4>
            <p>
                Before I started prototyping, I wanted to do research on similar apps in the space. The main apps I
                drew inspiration from was PictureThis which has similar features as it is an AI-powered plant (instead
                of waste) detection application. I also looked at our main competitor's app which has a search bar
                feature in which you can search for your item and it return how to properly dispose of it. This app also
                has a pickup schedule and we decided that to stay competitive we should also provide these two features
                in our app. The figma page below shows my analysis and heuristic evaluation when experimenting with
                these apps. It also has an analysis of the website for the WOMBO app as they are a small company who's
                website serves mush of the same purpose that we wanted our app to serve.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450"
                    src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2F5zDeK3AedUOHh4Skf5sSOi%2FYande-Review-Work%3Fnode-id%3D107%253A1383"

                </iframe>
            </div>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 2em">Step 3: Design Language</h4>
            <p>
                For the Design Language, we decided to keep the app simple and modern. For the app logo, we chose to use
                the Poppins font and continued that throughout the app. The body font of the app is 18pt which is the
                WCAG 2.0 standard and there are a couple levels of headings with standard hierarchy that are easy to
                distinguish.
            </p>
            <p>
                We decided to make the app's primary color green to continue with theme based on the logo. The dark
                green in the logo was not WCAG AA compliant, however, so I found the closest shade of green with an
                appropriate contrast ratio. This was used for all major buttons and links.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img style="width: 350px; margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em" src="./imgs/ReviewContrast.png" />
            </div>

            <p>
                The original prototype had popup modules that displayed the result when you took a picture. I originally
                liked this idea as it created an immersive experience in which you never really left the camera.
                However, we quickly found that the module could not contain as much information as we wanted and also
                proved frustrating from an engineering perspective. To keep the immersive factor, I decided to create a
                card that slides up from the bottom with a result and keeps the image taken as the background behind the
                card. This makes it feel like you barely left the camera but also allows for an unlimited amount of
                content to be able to presented on the screen. Carrying with this card theme, elements on the UI are on
                rounded rectangular cards and other elements like images also have rounded corners.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img style="width: 350px; margin-top: 1.5em; margin-bottom: 1.5em" src="./imgs/phone_module.png" />
            </div>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 2em">Step 4: Prototyping and Wireframing</h4>
            <p>
                At this stage it was finally time to start prototyping the application. To do so, I began by creating
                frames
                that represent the flow identified in Step 1. I had to modify to this flow, however, because I needed to
                add additional features identified in Step 2 such as the pickup schedule screen. I found that the
                easiest way to do so would to have a simple three-item navigation bar at the bottom of the screen. After
                I
                had the basic frames layed out in figma, I started adding some of the text and UI elements from the
                existing
                application. At this stage, I had to modify to text on the app to make it more concise and user
                friendly. I
                also refined the design of elements by applying the design language solidified in Step 3. From here I
                was
                able to wireframe the prototype to make it full interfactional.
            </p>

            <div class="center">
                <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450"
                    src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2F5zDeK3AedUOHh4Skf5sSOi%2FYande-Review-Work%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1"
                    allowfullscreen>
                </iframe>
            </div>

            <p style="margin-top: 1.75em;">
                The figma frame above shows some of the iteration that went into making this prototype. The items inside
                of
                the black rectangle are part of the main prototype and the other frames are either old or experimental
                ideas. For
                example, at first the results page was just full screen before we made it a more immersive card that
                slides
                up. You can also see some of the UI testing I did in the example of the Search bar screen in which I
                have
                slight variations. I decided which one of these designs to settle on by interviewing users to see which
                was
                the most easy to read and most visually appealing. I also interviewed users during the whole design
                process
                to make sure the flow I created for the wireframe was intuitive.
