        <h1>IxD Case Study: The Hybrid Classroom</h1>

        <br>
        <p>
            This page houses my Interaction Design case study on the Hybrid Classroom. A hybrid classroom is defined as
            a dual-modality classroom in which students may attend either in-person or online. This project currently
            has 2 phases: <b>Observation</b> In which my teammates and I did research to understand the problem space
            and <b>Enable</b> in which I created a toolkit to bridge the disconnect that in-person and online students
            face while attempting to collaborate with each other.
        </p>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 100px"> Phase I: Observe </h2>
        <p> In this stage, five of my teammates and I arranged user interviews, ethnographic observations, and secondary
            research to understand the current state of the hybrid classroom in a recovering-COVID environment. Our goal
            was to understand decision-making in autonomous hybrid classes and why students attend in the modality that
            they do. We found that there were many social, health, and logistical reasons that students choose their
            modality outside of just COVID safety concerns. We presented our findings using an Ecosystem Map and
            Vignettes.

        <h2 style="margin-top: 100px"> Phase II: Enable </h2>
        <p>
            In this stage, I attempted to combat an opening that my team and I found in our research. The issue I chose
            to tackle was bridging the disconnect between in-person and online students while collaborating. To do this,
            I created a "toolkit" with materials to help close the collaboration gap between students of different
            modalities. The toolkit revolved around a Virtual Presence device that serves as a interactive analog for a
            virtual student. A Concept Drawing of the toolkit and a Journey Map was then created to show how I
            envisioned the kit working. From here, I prototyped the base of the virtual presence device by laser cutting
            wood and hooking up a Raspberry Pi with a motor. This served as a proof of concept I could test and demo.
