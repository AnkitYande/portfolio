        <p>
            This page is the culmination of work of my 5 week integrated design course on Digital Prototyping. The goal
            was to design an app to help students navigate campus during the Covid-19 pandemic. We started by
            brainstorming problems that students may face due to the pandemic and narrowed it down to the top
            three to focus on. We then created a Journey map that represents an example users' persona and emotional
            state as they navigate campus during the pandemic, as well as 10 high level requirement statements of what
            different user may want out of the app. After this, we came up with solutions to the three main issues that
            we identified and used them as the three main screes for our application. We then created an Information
            Architecture to lay out the content for the rest of the application.
            <br><br>
            From here, we were ready to develop a prototype in Figma. We started by creating a basic low-fidelity
            wireframe based on the information architecture created earlier. After this was down, we refined the design
            by applying the Design Language System created by Monday.com and then connected the pages together to make
            the prototype fully interactive. After we had a high-fidelity clickable prototype, we completed user testing
            to 1) see if user had any other major problems that weren't addressed by the app and 2) watch the user
            interact with the prototype to see if they ran into any pain points or had any suggestions. We then took
            these suggestions into account to create the final prototype below.
