        <h1>Design work for ReView Technology Inc.</h1>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 2em">Introduction</h2>
        <p style="margin-top: 2em">
            This page houses my design work for ReView Technology Inc. ReView is a machine learning powered tool that
            allows users to know if any item is recyclable or compostable in their area with only a picture. Their goal
            is to create a greener future by making it easier to sort your disposables. More on them can be found 
            <a href="https://www.reviewtechnology.ai/"> here </a>

        <h2 style="margin-top: 2em">Part 1: Logo Design</h2>
        <div class="tab">
            <h4 style="margin-top: 2em">Task</h4>
            <p>
                Redesign the current logo to better represent the company.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img style="height: 150px" src="./imgs/ReViewLogoOld.png" />
            </div>
            <h4 style="margin-top: 2em">Goals:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a combinational logo whose pictoral mark can be used stand alone as the app's icon</li>
                <li>Use a set of colors that better represent the company's identity</li>
                <li>Make the logo represent the app's functionality</li>
                <li>Make the logo minimal and modern</li>
            </ul>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5em">Step 1: Sketches</h4>
            <p>
                This was my first time actually designing a Logo for a client. I began by sketching different concepts
                for the logo on my iPad using Procreate. The left side of the following image show some of the moteifs I
                was experimenting with including a camera, cycling arrows, the letter 'R', a magnifying glass (to
                represent searching), and some leaves (to represent the environment).
            </p>
            <p>
                The right side of my divider shows 10 of the final logos I was most pleased with. The top rightmost a
                finished
                vector logo made in Adobe Illustrator, which I though would be a good final logo to present to the
                company. The finished logo is supposed to be a camera in the shape of a trashbin tying in the ideas of
                the app's core feature (using the camera) and what it detects (the user's disposables)
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img style="height: 400px; margin-top: 2em" src="./imgs/ReView_logos_1.png" />
            </div>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5em">Feedback</h4>
            <p>
                When presenting my final logo to the company it was clear that they did not understand the concept of
                the logo. They could not tell that the body of the camera was supposed to represent a wastebin and
                though that the logo was lacking overall. They though that logos 6 and 7 were actually the best and
                encouraged me to try to move forward with those.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img style="height: 200px; margin-top: 2em" src="./imgs/star_logos.png" />
            </div>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5em">Iteration</h4>
            <p>
                I took the two favored logos and brought them into Illustrator and began to refine them.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img style="height: 400px; margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em" src="./imgs/ReView_logos_2.png" />
            </div>
            <p>
                However, after this design session, I wasn't particularly happy with any of the logos. Playing around
                different colors did not help improve the logos substantially either. I decided to reach out to another
                UX designer with more experience to help me. Together we sketched out some more and ended up refining
                the ideo of a leaf camera combining some of my previous sketches. I brought these ideas into illustrator
                and refined them into presentable logos to show my clients.
            </p>
            <div class="center">
                <img style="height: 200px; margin-top: 2em" src="./imgs/ReView_logos_3.png" />
            </div>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 1.5em">Finalizing the Logo</h4>
            <p>
                The company ended up really liking this new logo but had a similar issue to the first one: they could
                not tell that it was supposed to represent a leaf at first. To fix this, we experimented with more of a
                green color. I also though that the two tone wordmark would be good for separating the companies name
                but they were adamant about keeping it spelled "ReView"
            </p>
            <p>
                After working with the founder, we ended up with a finalized logo with three primary colors that later
                became the basis of the company. We chose to stick with a simple font to capture the feeling of a
                technology startup. The logo met the goals of being a pictoral or combinational logo, used greens and
                blues to represent recycling, and symbolized the company's goal of creating a greener
                future, all while being modern and relatively minimal.
