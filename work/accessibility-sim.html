            This webpage is my final independent creative project for Digital Arts and Media BDP. For my project, I explored the
            importance of making the web a more accessible place. According to recent studies, the average person spends
            nearly 7 hours a day online. However, the internet is still not accessible to a large percentage of the
            population with disabilities. As of 2022, 96.8% of the top one million websites don't offer full
            accessibility, making it hard for millions of users to use the web on a daily basis. This includes 285
            million blind & vision-impaired people in the world as well as many others who have limited hearing and
            motor control. To raise awareness for this problem I created a website that simulates some of these
            disabilities. The first experience is a simulation in which the user must fill out a form with a shaky
            mouse. In the second simulation, users need to distinguish whether different counties on a map are safe from
            covid. A filter is applied to the map to simulate color blindness highlighting the importance of color
            contrast when designing websites. Users also have the ability to upload their own images and test out color
            schemes. In the third and final simulation, users need to try to buy a laptop from an e-commerce site using
            only a keyboard and a built-in screen reader. The website is completely hidden from the user and they must
            navigate by what they hearâ€”similar to how many blind and low-vision users use the web in the real world.
            Overall, I hope that by experiencing these simulations, people will gain a greater sense of empathy for
            people of different ability levels and share the message of the importance of digital accessibility. The
            website also provides many useful links for people who would like to learn more and help out!
