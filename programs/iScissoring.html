            This project explores taking selections of an object for the purpose of creating image compositions. The
            first selection method we developed is the polygon selection tool which uses Bresenham's line algorithm to
            interpolate between mouse clicks. The second selection method is the color selection tool which uses a Flood
            Fill algorithm to select all the pixels around a seed pixel that have a similar HSV to starting seed.
            The final and main selection method is Intelligent Scissoring. For this method, we first created an edge
            detection algorithm using the Canny Edge Detector. This involved converting the image to grayscale, applying
            a gaussian blur to the image, and then convoluting over the image with Horizontal and Vertical Sobel
            Operators. The results of these operators were then averaged to have a selection of all the edges. From here
            we could interpret the resulting image as a cost graph and used Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest
            path between a seed and the current mouse's position. Because the image is processed such that the edges
            have the lowest cost, the algorithm will be able to intelligently snap to the edges of the subject in an
            image. A presention of this process can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fcQCT_olAs">here</a>.
            From here the user can create a selection of a subject from a closed path and copy/paste the image to a new
            buffer. All of this can be done from our GUI written with Tkinter.
