            Plants are subject to a variety of disorders caused by diseases or environmental factors. The ability to
            detect
            and diagnose these disorders remotely provides advantages for agriculture. The goal was to develop software
            in
            Java that can remotely identify and differentiate between various crop pathologies. To accomplish this,
            images
            from webcam feeds were converted to an array of pixels and maximum and minimum thresholds for the hue,
            saturation, and value (HSV) of the infected regions of plants were determined. These values were used to
            create
            a mask of areas in the image that were within the correct color range which was then further processed to
            reduce
            noise.
