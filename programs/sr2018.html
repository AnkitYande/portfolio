            Similar to how humans can perceive depth with two eyes, a computer can measure distance using a stereoscopic
            camera system. The goal of this project was to develop software in Java that can successfully detect an
            object in two different camera feeds and then calculate the distance between the object and the cameras
            using trigonometry. First, an image detection algorithm was created using OpenCV libraries. The images from
            the webcam feeds were converted to a matrix and a maximum and minimum values for the hue, saturation, and
            value (HSV) of a monochromatic spherical target were determined experimentally. These values were used to
            create a mask of areas in the image that were within the correct color range. Noise was reduced by eroding
            the mask and clarity was added after by dilating the mask. Finally, a bounding box was created using the
            contours of the region that remained and the center was calculated. Trigonometry calculations were then
            performed by the computer using the center of the object on both feeds as well as characteristics of the
            cameras to calculate the distance and position of the object. This data was then compared to the actual
            distance and was used to create a distortion constant for more accurate calculations. Finally, the distance
            and positional information of the detected object was outputted using a text to speech software known as
            FreeTTS so that someone with visual impairments could use the audio directions to locate the object.
